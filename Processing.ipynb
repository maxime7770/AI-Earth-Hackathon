This method embraces recycling and reuse, taking a significant stride towards a circular economy.   Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources.  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time.  We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":41}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["scalability_words = [\"scale\", \"expand\", \"increased demand\", \"scale-up\", \"scale up\", \"scalability\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"mCQ-jiN3A2xm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#check for scability by see if how many of these words it has\n","scalability_scores = df[\"solution_processed\"].apply(lambda x: sum(word in x.lower() for word in scalability_words) if isinstance(x, str) else 0).tolist()"],"metadata":{"id":"7n_H0u73COdb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(scalability_scores)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iSKhnJUOC6S-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704582909653,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Raghav Jayanthi","userId":"01496439715980264560"}},"outputId":"55978bea-e90d-4d7b-fe62-d920fda2f47c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1300"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":53}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df[\"scalability_scores\"] = scalability_scores"],"metadata":{"id":"OUsU8j1FC72z"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":328},"id":"f3IBCS8TDD-i","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704582983964,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Raghav Jayanthi","userId":"01496439715980264560"}},"outputId":"c1cc1554-4da0-4117-fea7-5f7b76f22945"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id                                            problem  \\\n","0   1  The construction industry is indubitably one o...   \n","1   2  I'm sure you, like me, are feeling the heat -

This suite's primary facet remains the digital platform for e-waste management, focusing on managing e-waste and reducing environmental impact. This platform would also analyze the lifecycle of the client corporation's electronic products to identify areas to extend their lifespan, reduce energy consumption, and foster a culture of sharing or leasing equipment rather than an outright purchase.  However, beyond managing e-waste, the Suite will offer consulting services to corporations to help them redesign their business processes and customer offerings around the principles of the circular economy, encouraging them to manufacture products that are meant to be re-used, re-sold, or recycled.   The Suite will also incorporate an e-waste marketplace, where corporations can list their e-waste items to be sold to refurbishing companies, recyclers, or even other corporations that may have a use for them. This spurs an entrepreneurial ecosystem around e-waste, leading to the creation of jobs and businesses focused on recycling, refurbishing, and reusing e-waste, which enhances its financial impact.  It results in a win-win-win scenario: corporations make financial gains, consumers get access to cheaper electronics, and the environment benefits from reduced e-waste and conservation of resources. This value proposition leverages the benefits of the circular economy, pushing businesses toward sustainable practices while also ensuring profitability. The financial gain and sustainable business practices will increase their appeal to socially conscious investors and customers, further enhancing TechLoopâ\\x80\\x99s financial impact.   Through the service fee for the use of the platform, the revenue from consulting services, commission on transactions within the e-waste marketplace, TechLoop opens up revenue streams for businesses and itself and hence enhances its scalability and feasibility.

For example, a manufacturer could use AI-powered sensors to monitor the performance of its equipment and detect any abnormalities in real-time. If the system detects an issue, it can alert maintenance teams to take action before the equipment fails, reducing downtime and increasing the lifespan of the equipment.\\n2.\\tWaste Sorting: Waste sorting is a critical step in the circular economy, and AI can help optimize the process. For instance, an AI-powered robot could sort waste into different categories such as recyclable materials, organic waste, and non-recyclable waste. This approach could increase the amount of material that can be recycled and reduce the risk of human error in the sorting process.\\n3.\\tSmart Inventory Management: Smart inventory management can be implemented in retail and e-commerce businesses, among others. For example, an e-commerce business could use AI to predict demand for different products and adjust its inventory levels accordingly. By doing so, the business can avoid overproduction and reduce the amount of unsold products, leading to less waste and lower costs.\\n4.\\tProduct Design Optimization: Product design optimization can be applied in various industries, such as consumer electronics and furniture. For example, an AI algorithm could analyze the usage data of a product, such as a laptop, and suggest ways to make it more durable or repairable. By doing so, the product can have a longer lifespan, and the need for new products can be reduced.\\n5.\\tSustainable Supply Chain Management: Sustainable supply chain management can be implemented in various industries, such as food and apparel. For example, a food company could use AI to analyze its suppliers' performance and ensure that they meet sustainability criteria such as responsible sourcing and reduced carbon emissions. This approach can help the company reduce its environmental impact and improve its sustainability performance.\\n6.\\tCircular Business Models: AI can help companies implement circular business models, such as product-as-a-service, where customers pay for access to a product rather than owning it outright. For example, a lighting company could offer lighting-as-a-service, where customers pay for access to lighting systems rather than purchasing and disposing of their own light bulbs. This approach can reduce waste and create new revenue streams for the company.\\n7.\\tEnergy Management: AI can optimize energy consumption in various industries, such as buildings and transportation. For instance, a building could use AI to analyze its energy usage patterns and suggest ways to reduce energy consumption, such as adjusting the temperature or turning off lights in unused areas. This approach can help the building reduce its carbon footprint and save on energy costs.\\n8.\\tSustainable Packaging: AI can help companies optimize their packaging designs to reduce waste and improve recyclability. For example, an AI algorithm could analyze the characteristics of a product and suggest the optimal packaging design to reduce the amount of material used while ensuring the product's safety during transport. This approach can reduce waste and improve the circularity of the packaging materials.\\n9.\\tWater Management: AI can optimize water consumption in various industries, such as agriculture and manufacturing. For example, an AI-powered irrigation system could analyze soil moisture levels and weather patterns to optimize water usage and reduce waste. This approach can help reduce the amount of water used in agriculture and manufacturing processes and improve the efficiency of water usage.\\n10.\\tAutonomous Waste Collection: Autonomous waste collection can be implemented in various industries, such as waste management and transportation. For example, an autonomous waste collection vehicle could collect waste from designated areas using AI-powered sensors and route optimization algorithms. This approach can reduce the need for manual waste collection, improve the efficiency of waste management, and reduce carbon emissions from waste collection vehicles.\\n\\n¥\\tNovelty: The use of AI to optimize the circular economy is a relatively new and rapidly developing field. One example of a novel solution is the use of machine learning algorithms to optimize the routing of waste collection trucks, which can help reduce the time, fuel, and emissions associated with waste collection.\\n¥\\tEnvironmental Impact: The ten solutions proposed aim to reduce waste, improve resource efficiency, and minimize carbon emissions. One example of a solution with a significant environmental impact is the use of AI-powered waste sorting, which can help identify and sort recyclable materials more effectively, reducing the amount of waste that goes to landfills.\\n¥\\tFinancial Impact: The ten solutions can create significant financial value for businesses by reducing waste and improving resource efficiency. One example of a solution with a significant financial impact is the use of predictive maintenance, which can help reduce equipment downtime and maintenance costs, improving operational efficiency and productivity.\\n¥\\tFeasibility and Scalability of Implementation: The feasibility and scalability of implementing the ten solutions vary, depending on the specific approach and industry. One example of a solution that is both feasible and scalable is the use of AI-powered energy management systems, which can optimize energy use in buildings and facilities, reducing energy consumption and costs. This solution is already widely adopted in many industries and can be easily scaled up with the use of AI.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":235}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_sorted_df[\"problem\"][4]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"_xiW9dYftsKO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704595813652,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":129,"user":{"displayName":"Raghav
